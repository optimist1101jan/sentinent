### 🌱 Aim Evolution — Persistent Character Agent

**Phase 1 — Curiosity 🧪**

* Build a Python wrapper / guardrail so small LLMs can sound more human.
* Focus: prompt shaping + conversational flow.

**Phase 2 — Memory 🧠**

* Realization: stateless chat feels fake.
* Add persistence → memory + identity + time awareness.

**Phase 3 — Personality & Behavior 🎭**

* Add mood, feelings, circadian rhythm, proximity.
* System becomes more “alive”.
* Result: feature explosion → instability 💥

**Phase 4 — Reality Check 🧱**

* Too many features → things start breaking.
* Rebuild with minimal features to deeply understand the system.
* Shift from *feature chasing* → *system understanding*.

**Phase 5 — Model Independence Goal 🤖**

* Aim: consistent identity across small and large models.
* Experiment across model sizes.
* Temporary decision: use Gemini 12B for stable testing baseline.

**Phase 6 — Strategic Pivot 🧭**

* Realization: reliability > squeezing performance from tiny models.
* New goal: build **robust, stable AI system for mid/large models first**.
* Focus shifts from “model problem” → “software engineering problem”.

**Phase 7 — Production Mindset ⚙️**

* Add structured logging system.
* Start building observability.
* Think about failures, retries, debugging, runtime behavior.

**Phase 8 — Quality & Reliability ✅**

* Begin testing strategy.
* Move toward production readiness and maintainability.

### 🎯 Current Aim (where you are now)

Build a **stable, observable, testable AI system** that:

* 👤 Maintains persistent identity and memory
* 🌊 Streams responses in real time
* 🛠️ Is reliable and debuggable
* 🚀 Can evolve into a production-grade agent framework
